.gitignore: This file lists the files and folders that should be ignored by version control systems like Git.

node_modules/: This folder contains all the third-party packages and dependencies used in your project. It's created and managed by npm.

public/: This is where static assets like images, fonts, and other files that are directly accessible by the browser are stored. For example, favicon.ico is the default icon for your website.

src/: This is the main source code directory where you'll write most of your application code.

pages/: This is a special folder in Next.js where each file corresponds to a route in your application. For example, index.js corresponds to the root route ("/").

components/: This folder is for housing reusable React components that you'll use throughout your application.

styles/: Here you can put your global styles using CSS or any CSS-in-JS solution. globals.css is a good place to define your base styles.

package.json: This file holds metadata about your project and its dependencies. You can also define scripts, which are commands you can run using npm.

package-lock.json: This file is automatically generated and locks the versions of dependencies to ensure consistency across different environments.
